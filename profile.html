            <h2>The Ugly Duckling</h2>
                <p>In her early years, Katie DeMet was a shy child.
                    Her mother used to take her after school to the local park almost every
                    day where she worked as a vendor. Whenever Katie felt out of place with
                    the other children she would wander off to the pond where she found
                    the local flock of ducks to play with. Katie found feeding and watching 
                    the ducks to be so much fun, that she found herself looking forward to it.

            <h2>The Hatching of RubberDucky</h2>
                <p>As Katie grew, her mother eventually found work closer to the city and
                    the long evenings at the park ended. In tribute to her old duck friends,
                    Katie began making duck replicas out of paper mache or popsickle sticks.
                    Over the years she found herself collecting all kinds of duck merchandise
                    and collecting pictures. When Katie finally got into coding in college, 
                    the plethora of duck figurines hit the internet and became a sensation
                    on social media. Seeing the high demand for duck and duck figurine pictures
                    lead Katie to create the RubberDucky site that we all know and love today!
