The internet is essentially a network of interconnected computers.
Today's internet infrastructure typically consists of one or more computers
connected to a special computer called a router. The router can then relay
the computer message to a modem that translates the computer language into 
the already established telephone line system that connects many homes and 
offices already. The modem allows the message to travel to and from the 
internet service provider and then back to another router connected to the
end point on some other computer.

The web is more like software that is build using the infrastructure of the 
internet. It's much like a collection of documents that are read and
interpreted by a variety of web and computer languages. When a person clicks
on a link on a website, the computer will look inside of the anchor tag of the 
html file for the new address to navigate to. First the computer has to 
translate the domain name into an IP address. It will look at browsing history,
information stored in the router or with the ISP, or it will look through
the DNS. A request is then sent from the client computer to the server to 
download the files for that page. Typically files are split into much smaller
packets to make web browsing faster and allow web pages to be available to
multiple computers simultaneously. The html, css, and javascript files are 
also typically translated into JSON files during transport to allow browsers 
and servers to talk to each other. Once the client computer receives the files 
they're translated back into html, css and javascript to be redered on the 
page.
